## Packages

*Please make sure that you have installed the following packages*:

```{r}
pks <- c("dplyr",
"gstat",
"mapview",
"nngeo",
"nomisr",
"osmdata",
"rnaturalearth",
"sf",
"spatialreg",

```

The most important package is [sf: Simple Features for R](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/). users are strongly encouraged to install the sf binary packages from CRAN. If that does not work, please have a look at the [installation instructions](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/). It requires software packages GEOS, GDAL and PROJ.


## Coordinates

In general, spatial data is structured like conventional/tidy data (e.g. data.frames, matrices), but has one additional dimension: every observation is linked to some sort of geo-spatial information. Most common types of spatial information are:

-   Points (one coordinate pair)

-   Lines (two coordinate pairs)

-   Polygons (at least three coordinate pairs)

-   Regular grids (one coordinate pair for centroid + raster / grid size)

### Coordinate reference system (CRS)

In its raw form, a pair of coordinates consists of two numerical values. For instance, the pair `c(51.752595, -1.262801)` describes the location of Nuffield College in Oxford (one point). The fist number represents the latitude (north-south direction), the second number is the longitude (west-east direction), both are in decimal degrees.

![Figure: Latitude and longitude, Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system)](fig/lat-long.png)

However, we need to specify a reference point for latitudes and longitudes (in the Figure above: equator and Greenwich). For instance, the pair of coordinates above comes from Google Maps which returns GPS coordinates in 'WGS 84' ([EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326)).

```{r}
# Coordinate pairs of two locations
coords1 <- c(51.752595, -1.262801)
coords2 <- c(51.753237, -1.253904)
coords <- rbind(coords1, coords2)

# Conventional data frame
nuffield.df <- data.frame(name = c("Nuffield College", "Radcliffe Camera"),
                          address = c("New Road", "Radcliffe Sq"),
                          lat = coords[,1], lon = coords[,2])

head(nuffield.df)

# Combine to spatial data frame
nuffield.spdf <- st_as_sf(nuffield.df, 
                          coords = c("lon", "lat"), # Order is important
                          crs = 4326) # EPSG number of CRS

# Map
mapview(nuffield.spdf, zcol = "name")

```

### Projected CRS

However, different data providers use different CRS. For instance, spatial data in the UK usually uses 'OSGB 1936 / British National Grid' ([EPSG:27700](https://epsg.io/27700)). Here, coordinates are in meters, and projected onto a planar 2D space.

There are a lot of different CRS projections, and different national statistics offices provide data in different projections. Data providers usually specify which reference system they use. This is important as using the correct reference system and projection is crucial for plotting and manipulating spatial data.

If you do not know the correct CRS, try starting with a standards CRS like [EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326) if you have decimal degree like coordinates. If it looks like projected coordinates, try searching for the country or region in CRS libraries like [https://epsg.io/](https://epsg.io/). However, you must check if the projected coordinates match their real location, e.g. using `mapview()`.

### Why different projections?

By now, (most) people agree that [the earth is not flat](https://r-spatial.org/r/2020/06/17/s2.html). So, to plot data on a 2D planar surface and to perform certain operations on a planar world, we need to make some re-projections. Depending on where we are, different re-projections of our data (globe in this case) might work better than others.

```{r}
world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
class(world)
st_crs(world)

# Extract a country and plot in current CRS (WGS84)
ger.spdf <- world[world$name == "Germany", ]
plot(st_geometry(ger.spdf))

# Now, let's transform Germany into a CRS optimized for Iceland
ger_rep.spdf <- st_transform(ger.spdf, crs = 5325)
plot(st_geometry(ger_rep.spdf))

```

Depending on the angle, a 2D projection of the earth looks different. It is important to choose a suitable projection for the available spatial data. For more information on CRS and re-projection, see e.g. @Lovelace.2019 or [Stefan Jünger](https://stefanjuenger.github.io/) & [Anne-Kathrin Stroppe](https://www.gesis.org/institut/mitarbeitendenverzeichnis/person/Anne-Kathrin.Stroppe)'s [GESIS workshop materials](https://github.com/StefanJuenger/gesis-workshop-geospatial-techniques-R-2023).

## Importing some real world data

`sf` imports many of the most common spatial data files, like geojson, gpkg, or shp.

### London shapefile (polygon)

Let's get some administrative boundaries for London from the [London Datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london). We use the `sf` package and its funtion `st_read()` to import the data.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Create subdir (all data withh be stored in "_data")
dn <- "_data"
ifelse(dir.exists(dn), "Exists", dir.create(dn))

# Download zip file and unzip
tmpf <- tempfile()
boundary.link <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london/9ba8c833-6370-4b11-abdc-314aa020d5e0/statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip"
download.file(boundary.link, tmpf)
unzip(zipfile = tmpf, exdir = paste0(dn))
unlink(tmpf)

# This is a shapefile
# We only need the MSOA layer for now
msoa.spdf <- st_read(dsn = paste0(dn, "/statistical-gis-boundaries-london/ESRI"),
                     layer = "MSOA_2011_London_gen_MHW" # Note: no file ending
                     )

```

The object `msoa.spdf` is our spatial data.frame. It looks essentially like a conventional data.frame, but has some additional attributes and geo-graphical information stored with it. Most importantly, notice the column `geometry`, which contains a list of polygons. In most cases, we have one polygon for each line / observation.

```{r, cache=FALSE}
head(msoa.spdf)

```

Shapefiles are still among the most common formats to store and transmit spatial data, despite them being inefficient (file size and file number). 

However, `sf` reads everything spatial, such as `geo.json`, which usually is more efficient, but less common (but we're getting there).

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Download file
ulez.link <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/ultra_low_emissions_zone/936d71d8-c5fc-40ad-a392-6bec86413b48/CentralUltraLowEmissionZone.geojson"
download.file(ulez.link, paste0(dn, "/ulez.json"))

# Read geo.json
st_layers(paste0(dn, "/ulez.json"))
ulez.spdf <- st_read(dsn = paste0(dn, "/ulez.json")) # here dsn is simply the file
head(ulez.spdf)
```

Again, this looks like a conventional `data.frame` but has the additional column `geometry` containing the coordinates of each observation. `st_geometry()` returns only the geographic object and `st_drop_geometry()` only the `data.frame` without the coordinates. We can plot the object using `mapview()`.

```{r}
mapview(msoa.spdf[, "POPDEN"])
```

### Census API (admin units)

Now that we have some boundaries and shapes of spatial units in London, we can start looking for different data sources to populate the geometries.

A good source for demographic data is for instance the 2011 census. Below we use the nomis API to retrieve population data for London, See the [Vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nomisr/vignettes/introduction.html) for more information (Guest users are limited to 25,000 rows per query). Below is a wrapper to avoid some errors with sex and urban-rural cross-tabulation in some of the data.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
### For larger request, register and set key
# Sys.setenv(NOMIS_API_KEY = "XXX")
# nomis_api_key(check_env = TRUE)

x <- nomis_data_info()

# Get London ids
london_ids <- msoa.spdf$MSOA11CD

### Get key statistics ids
# select requires tables (https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/census_2011_ks)
# Let's get KS201EW (ethnic group), KS205EW (passport held), and KS402EW (housing tenure)

# Get internal ids
stats <- c("KS201EW", "KS402EW", "KS205EW")
oo <- which(grepl(paste(stats, collapse = "|"), x$name.value))
ksids <- x$id[oo]
ksids # This are the internal ids


### look at meta information
q <- nomis_overview(ksids[1])
head(q)
a <- nomis_get_metadata(id = ksids[1], concept = "GEOGRAPHY", type = "type")
a # TYPE297 is MSOA level

b <- nomis_get_metadata(id = ksids[1], concept = "MEASURES", type = "TYPE297")
b # 20100 is the measure of absolute numbers


### Query data in loop over the required statistics
for(i in ksids){

  # Determin if data is divided by sex or urban-rural
  nd <- nomis_get_metadata(id = i)
  if("RURAL_URBAN" %in% nd$conceptref){
    UR <- TRUE
  }else{
    UR <- FALSE
  }
  if("C_SEX" %in% nd$conceptref){
    SEX <- TRUE
  }else{
    SEX <- FALSE
  }

  # make data request
  if(UR == TRUE){
    if(SEX == TRUE){
      tmp_en <- nomis_get_data(id = i, time = "2011",
                               geography = london_ids, # replace with "TYPE297" for all MSOAs
                               measures = 20100, RURAL_URBAN = 0, C_SEX = 0)
    }else{
      tmp_en <- nomis_get_data(id = i, time = "2011",
                               geography = london_ids, # replace with "TYPE297" for all MSOAs
                               measures = 20100, RURAL_URBAN = 0)
    }
  }else{
    if(SEX == TRUE){
      tmp_en <- nomis_get_data(id = i, time = "2011",
                               geography = london_ids, # replace with "TYPE297" for all MSOAs
                               measures = 20100, C_SEX = 0)
    }else{
      tmp_en <- nomis_get_data(id = i, time = "2011",
                               geography = london_ids, # replace with "TYPE297" for all MSOAs
                               measures = 20100)
    }

  }

  # Append (in case of different regions)
  ks_tmp <- tmp_en

  # Make lower case names
  names(ks_tmp) <- tolower(names(ks_tmp))
  names(ks_tmp)[names(ks_tmp) == "geography_code"] <- "msoa11"
  names(ks_tmp)[names(ks_tmp) == "geography_name"] <- "name"

  # replace weird cell codes
  onlynum <- which(grepl("^[[:digit:]]+$", ks_tmp$cell_code))
  if(length(onlynum) != 0){
    code <- substr(ks_tmp$cell_code[-onlynum][1], 1, 7)
    if(is.na(code)){
      code <- i
    }
    ks_tmp$cell_code[onlynum] <- paste0(code, "_", ks_tmp$cell_code[onlynum])
  }

  # save codebook
  ks_cb <- unique(ks_tmp[, c("date", "cell_type", "cell", "cell_code", "cell_name")])

  ### Reshape
  ks_res <- tidyr::pivot_wider(ks_tmp, id_cols = c("msoa11", "name"),
                               names_from = "cell_code",
                               values_from = "obs_value")

  ### Merge
  if(i == ksids[1]){
    census_keystat.df <- ks_res
    census_keystat_cb.df <- ks_cb
  }else{
    census_keystat.df <- merge(census_keystat.df, ks_res, by = c("msoa11", "name"), all = TRUE)
    census_keystat_cb.df <- rbind(census_keystat_cb.df, ks_cb)
  }

}


# Descriptions are saved in the codebook
head(census_keystat_cb.df)
save(census_keystat_cb.df, file = "_data/Census_codebook.RData")
```

Now, we have one file containing the geometries of MSOAs and one file with the census information on ethnic groups. Obviously, we can easily merge them together using the MSOA identifiers.

```{r}
msoa.spdf <- merge(msoa.spdf, census_keystat.df,
                   by.x = "MSOA11CD", by.y = "msoa11", all.x = TRUE)
```

And we can, for instance, plot the spatial distribution of ethnic groups.

```{r}

msoa.spdf$per_white <- msoa.spdf$KS201EW_100 / msoa.spdf$KS201EW0001 * 100
msoa.spdf$per_mixed <- msoa.spdf$KS201EW_200 / msoa.spdf$KS201EW0001 * 100
msoa.spdf$per_asian <- msoa.spdf$KS201EW_300 / msoa.spdf$KS201EW0001 * 100
msoa.spdf$per_black <- msoa.spdf$KS201EW_400 / msoa.spdf$KS201EW0001 * 100
msoa.spdf$per_other <- msoa.spdf$KS201EW_500 / msoa.spdf$KS201EW0001 * 100

mapview(msoa.spdf[, "per_white"])

```

If you're interested in more data sources, see for instance [APIs for social scientists: A collaborative review](https://bookdown.org/paul/apis_for_social_scientists/) by Paul C. Bauer, Camille Landesvatter, Lion Behrens. It's a collection of several APIs for social sciences.

### Gridded data

So far, we have queried data on administrative units. However, often data comes on other spatial scales. For instance, we might be interested in the amount of air pollution, which is provided on a regular grid across the UK from [Defra](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data).

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Download
pol.link <- "https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/datastore/pcm/mapno22011.csv"
download.file(pol.link, paste0(dn, "/mapno22011.csv"))
pol.df <- read.csv(paste0(dn, "/mapno22011.csv"), skip = 5, header = T, sep = ",",
                      stringsAsFactors = F, na.strings = "MISSING")

head(pol.df)
```

The data comes as point data with x and y as coordinates. We have to transform this into spatial data first. We first setup a spatial points object with `st_as_sf`. Subsequently, we transform the point coordinates into a regular grid. We use a buffer method `st_buffer` with "diameter", and only one segment per quadrant (`nQuadSegs`). This gives us a 1x1km regular grid.

```{r}
# Build spatial object
pol.spdf <- st_as_sf(pol.df, coords = c("x", "y"),
                    crs = 27700)

# we transform the point coordinates into a regular grid with "diameter" 500m
pol.spdf <- st_buffer(pol.spdf, dist = 500, nQuadSegs  = 1,
                      endCapStyle = 'SQUARE')

# Plot NO2
plot(pol.spdf[, "no22011"], border = NA)
```

### OpenStreetMap (points)

Another interesting data source is the OpenStreetMap API, which provides information about the geographical location of a serious of different indicators. Robin Lovelace provides a nice introduction to the [osmdata API](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osmdata/vignettes/osmdata.html). Available features can be found on [OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features).

First we create a bounding box of where we want to query data. `st_bbox()` can be used to get bounding boxes of an existing spatial object (needs `CRS = 4326`). An alternative would be to use `opq(bbox = 'greater london uk')`.

```{r}
# bounding box of where we want to query data
q <- opq(bbox = st_bbox(st_transform(msoa.spdf, 4326)))
```

And we want to get data for all pubs and bars which are within this bounding box.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# First build the query of location of pubs in London
osmq <- add_osm_feature(q, key = "amenity", value = "pub")

# And then query the data
pubs.osm <- osmdata_sf(osmq)
```

Right now there are some results in polygons, some in points, and they overlap. Often, data from OSM needs some manual cleaning. Sometimes the same features are represented by different spatial objects (e.g. points + polygons).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Make unique points / polygons
pubs.osm <- unique_osmdata(pubs.osm)

# Get points and polygons (there are barley any pubs as polygons, so we ignore them)
pubs.points <- pubs.osm$osm_points
pubs.polys <- pubs.osm$osm_multipolygons

# # Drop OSM file
# rm(pubs.osm); gc()

# Reduce to point object only
pubs.spdf <- pubs.points

# Reduce to a few variables
pubs.spdf <- pubs.spdf[, c("osm_id", "name", "addr:postcode", "diet:vegan")]
```

Again, we can inspect the results with `mapview`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("_data/osm_d.RData")
```

```{r}
mapview(st_geometry(pubs.spdf))
```

Note that OSM is solely based on contribution by users, and the **quality of OSM data varies**. Usually data quality is better in larger cities, and better for more stable features (such as hospitals, train stations, highways) rahter than pubs or restaurants which regularly appear and disappear. However, data from [London Datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/cultural-infrastructure-map) would indicate more pubs than what we find with OSM.

### Save

We will store the created data to use them again in the next session.

```{r}
save(msoa.spdf, file = "_data/msoa_spatial.RData")
save(ulez.spdf, file = "_data/ulez_spatial.RData")
save(pol.spdf, file = "_data/pollution_spatial.RData")
save(pubs.spdf, file = "_data/pubs_spatial.RData")
```


## Data Manipulation

### Required packages {.unnumbered}

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
pkgs <- c("sf", "gstat", "mapview", "nngeo", "rnaturalearth", "dplyr",
          "nomisr", "osmdata", "tidyr", "texreg", "downlit", "xml2") 
lapply(pkgs, require, character.only = TRUE)

```




Having data with geo-spatial information allows to perform a variety of methods to manipulate and link different data sources. Commonly used methods include 1) subsetting, 2) point-in-polygon operations, 3) distance measures, 4) intersections or buffer methods.

The [online Vignettes of the sf package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/) provide a comprehensive overview of the multiple ways of spatial manipulations.

#### Check if data is on common projection

```{r}
st_crs(msoa.spdf) == st_crs(pol.spdf)
st_crs(msoa.spdf) == st_crs(pubs.spdf)
st_crs(msoa.spdf) == st_crs(ulez.spdf)
```

The spatial data files are on different projections. Before we can do any spatial operations with them, we have to transform them into a common projection.

```{r}
# MSOA in different crs --> transform
pol.spdf <- st_transform(pol.spdf, crs = st_crs(msoa.spdf))
pubs.spdf <- st_transform(pubs.spdf, crs = st_crs(msoa.spdf))
ulez.spdf <- st_transform(ulez.spdf, crs = st_crs(msoa.spdf))


# Check if all geometries are valid, and make valid if needed
msoa.spdf <- st_make_valid(msoa.spdf)

```

The `st_make_valid()` can help if the spatial geometries have some problems such as holes or points that don't match exactly.

### Subsetting

We can subset spatial data in a similar way as we subset conventional data.frames or matrices. For instance, below we simply reduce the pollution grid across the UK to observations in London only.

```{r}

# Subset to pollution estimates in London
pol_sub.spdf <- pol.spdf[msoa.spdf, ] # or:
pol_sub.spdf <- st_filter(pol.spdf, msoa.spdf)
mapview(pol_sub.spdf)

```

Or we can reverse the above and exclude all intersecting units by specifying `st_disjoint` as alternative spatial operation using the `op =` option (note the empty space for column selection). `st_filter()` with the `.predicate` option does the same job. See the [sf Vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/vignettes/sf3.html) for more operations.

```{r}
# Subset pubs to pubs not in the ulez area
sub2.spdf <- pubs.spdf[ulez.spdf, , op = st_disjoint] # or:
sub2.spdf <- st_filter(pubs.spdf, ulez.spdf, .predicate = st_disjoint)
mapview(sub2.spdf)
```

We can easily create indicators of whether an MSOA is within ulez or not.

```{r}
msoa.spdf$ulez <- 0

# intersecting lsoas
within <- msoa.spdf[ulez.spdf,]

# use their ids to create binary indicator 
msoa.spdf$ulez[which(msoa.spdf$MSOA11CD %in% within$MSOA11CD)] <- 1
table(msoa.spdf$ulez)
```

### Point in polygon

We are interested in the number of pubs in each MSOA. So, we count the number of points in each polygon.

```{r}
# Assign MSOA to each point
pubs_msoa.join <- st_join(pubs.spdf, msoa.spdf, join = st_within)

# Count N by MSOA code (drop geometry to speed up)
pubs_msoa.join <- dplyr::count(st_drop_geometry(pubs_msoa.join),
                               MSOA11CD = pubs_msoa.join$MSOA11CD,
                               name = "pubs_count")
sum(pubs_msoa.join$pubs_count)

# Merge and replace NAs with zero (no matches, no pubs)
msoa.spdf <- merge(msoa.spdf, pubs_msoa.join,
                   by = "MSOA11CD", all.x = TRUE)
msoa.spdf$pubs_count[is.na(msoa.spdf$pubs_count)] <- 0

```

### Distance measures

We might be interested in the distance to the nearest pub. Here, we use the package `nngeo` to find k nearest neighbours with the respective distance.

```{r}
# Use geometric centroid of each MSOA
cent.sp <- st_centroid(msoa.spdf[, "MSOA11CD"])

# Get K nearest neighbour with distance
knb.dist <- st_nn(cent.sp, 
                  pubs.spdf,
                  k = 1,             # number of nearest neighbours
                  returnDist = TRUE, # we also want the distance
                  progress = FALSE)
msoa.spdf$dist_pubs <- unlist(knb.dist$dist)
summary(msoa.spdf$dist_pubs)

```

### Intersections + Buffers

We may also want the average pollution within 1 km radius around each MSOA centroid. Note that it is usually better to use a ego-centric method where you calculate the average within a distance rather than using the characteristic of the intersecting cells only [@Lee.2008; @Mohai.2007].

Therefore, we first create a buffer with `st_buffer()` around each midpoint and subsequently use `st_intersetion()` to calculate the overlap.

```{r}
# Create buffer (1km radius)
cent.buf <- st_buffer(cent.sp, 
                      dist = 1000) # dist in meters
mapview(cent.buf)

# Add area of each buffer (in this constant) 
cent.buf$area <- as.numeric(st_area(cent.buf))

# Calculate intersection of pollution grid and buffer
int.df <- st_intersection(cent.buf, pol.spdf)
int.df$int_area <- as.numeric(st_area(int.df)) # area of intersection

# Area of intersection as share of buffer
int.df$area_per <- int.df$int_area / int.df$area
```

And we use the percent overalp areas as the weights to calculate a weighted mean.

```{r}
# Aggregate as weighted mean
int.df <- st_drop_geometry(int.df)
int.df$no2_weighted <- int.df$no22011 * int.df$area_per
int.df <- aggregate(list(no2 = int.df[, "no2_weighted"]), 
                    by = list(MSOA11CD = int.df$MSOA11CD),
                    sum)

# Merge back to spatial data.frame
msoa.spdf <- merge(msoa.spdf, int.df, by = "MSOA11CD", all.x = TRUE)

mapview(msoa.spdf[, "no2"])

```

Note: for buffer related methods, it often makes sense to use population weighted centroids instead of geographic centroids (see [here](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons::middle-layer-super-output-areas-december-2011-population-weighted-centroids/about) for MSOA population weighted centroids). However, often this information is not available.


### and more

There are more spatial operation possible using sf. Have a look at the [sf Cheatsheet](fig/sf.pdf).

## Data visualisation

For mapping

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
pkgs <- c("tmap", "tmaptools", "viridisLite", 
          "ggplot2", "ggthemes", "rmapshaper") 
lapply(pkgs, require, character.only = TRUE)

```



A large advantage of spatial data is that different data sources can be connected and combined. Another nice advantage is: you can create very nice maps. And it's quite easy to do! [Stefan Jünger](https://stefanjuenger.github.io/) & [Anne-Kathrin Stroppe](https://www.gesis.org/institut/mitarbeitendenverzeichnis/person/Anne-Kathrin.Stroppe) provide more comprehensive materials on mapping in their [GESIS workshop on geospatial techniques in R](https://github.com/StefanJuenger/gesis-workshop-geospatial-techniques-R-2023).

Many packages and functions can be used to plot maps of spatial data. For instance, ggplot as a function to plot spatial data using `geom_sf()`. I am personally a fan of `tmap`, which makes many steps easier (but sometimes is less flexible).

A great tool for choosing coulour is for instance [Colorbrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/). `viridisLite` provides another great resource to chose colours.

### Tmaps

For instance, lets plot the NO2 estimates using tmap + `tm_fill()` (there are lots of alternatives like `tm_shape`, `tm_points()`, `tm_dots()`).

```{r}

# Define colours
cols <- viridis(n = 7, direction = 1, option = "C")

mp1 <-  tm_shape(msoa.spdf) + 
  tm_fill(col = "no2", 
          style = "fisher", # algorithm to def cut points
          n = 7, # Number of requested cut points
          palette = cols, # colours
          alpha = 1, # transparency 
          title = "NO2", 
          legend.hist = FALSE # histogram next to map?
          ) +
  tm_borders(col = "white", lwd = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) 

mp1

```

Tmap allows to easily combine different objects by defining a new object via `tm_shape()`.

```{r}

# Define colours
cols <- viridis(n = 7, direction = 1, option = "C")

mp1 <-  tm_shape(msoa.spdf) + 
  tm_fill(col = "no2", 
          style = "fisher", # algorithm to def cut points
          n = 7, # Number of requested cut points
          palette = cols, # colours
          alpha = 1, # transparency 
          title = "NO2", 
          legend.hist = FALSE # histogram next to map?
          ) +
  tm_borders(col = "white", lwd = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_shape(ulez.spdf) +
  tm_borders(col = "red", lwd = 1, alpha = 1) 

mp1

```

And it is easy to change the layout.

```{r}

# Define colours
cols <- viridis(n = 7, direction = 1, option = "C")

mp1 <-  tm_shape(msoa.spdf) + 
  tm_fill(col = "no2", 
          style = "fisher", # algorithm to def cut points
          n = 7, # Number of requested cut points
          palette = cols, # colours
          alpha = 1, # transparency 
          title = expression('in'~mu*'g'/m^{3}), 
          legend.hist = FALSE # histogram next to map?
          ) +
  tm_borders(col = "white", lwd = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_shape(ulez.spdf) +
  tm_borders(col = "red", lwd = 1, alpha = 1) +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE,
            legend.frame = TRUE, legend.bg.color = TRUE,
            legend.position = c("right", "bottom"),
            legend.outside = FALSE,
            main.title = "NO2", 
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.6,
            legend.title.size = 0.8,
            legend.text.size = 0.8)

mp1

```



### ggplot

For those of you have rather stick with the basic ggplot package, we can also use ggplot for spatial maps.

```{r}
gp <- ggplot(msoa.spdf)+
    geom_sf(aes(fill = no2))+
    scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "B")+
    coord_sf(datum = NA)+
    theme_map()+
    theme(legend.position = c(.9, .6))
gp
```

```{r}
# Get some larger scale boundaries
borough.spdf <- st_read(dsn = paste0("_data", "/statistical-gis-boundaries-london/ESRI"),
                     layer = "London_Borough_Excluding_MHW" # Note: no file ending
                     )

# transform to only inner lines
borough_inner <- ms_innerlines(borough.spdf)

# Plot with inner lines
gp <- ggplot(msoa.spdf)+
    geom_sf(aes(fill = no2), color = NA)+
    scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "A")+
    geom_sf(data = borough_inner, color = "gray92")+
    geom_sf(data = ulez.spdf, color = "red", fill = NA)+
    coord_sf(datum = NA)+
    theme_map()+
    labs(fill = "NO2")+
    theme(legend.position = c(.9, .6))
gp
```


## Exercise

1) What is the difference between a spatial "sf" object and a conventional "data.frame"? What's the purpose of the function `st_drop_geometry()`?

It's the same. A spatial "sf" object just has an additional column containing the spatial coordinates.

2) Using msoa.spdf, please create a spatial data frame that contains only the MSOA areas that are within the ulez zone.

```{r}
sub4.spdf <- msoa.spdf[ulez.spdf, ]
```


3) Please create a map for London (or only the msoa-ulez subset) which shows the share of Asian residents (or any other ethnic group).

```{r}
gp <- ggplot(msoa.spdf)+
    geom_sf(aes(fill = per_asian))+
    scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "E")+
    coord_sf(datum = NA)+
    theme_map()+
    theme(legend.position = c(.9, .6))
gp
```


4) Please calculate the distance of each MSOA to the London city centre 
  a) use google maps to get lon and lat, 
  b) use `st_as_sf()` to create the spatial point
  c) use `st_distance()` to calculate the distance
  
```{r}
### Distance to city center
# Define centre
centre <- st_as_sf(data.frame(lon = -0.128120855701165, 
                              lat = 51.50725909644806),
                   coords = c("lon", "lat"), 
                   crs = 4326)
# Reproject
centre <- st_transform(centre, crs = st_crs(msoa.spdf))
# Calculate distance
msoa.spdf$dist_centre <- as.numeric(st_distance(msoa.spdf, centre)) / 1000
# hist(msoa.spdf$dist_centre)
```
  
  
5) Can you create a plot with the distance to the city centre and pub counts next to each other?  


```{r}

# Define colours
cols <- viridis(n = 10, direction = 1, option = "B")
cols2 <- viridis(n = 10, direction = 1, option = "E")


mp1 <-  tm_shape(msoa.spdf) + 
  tm_fill(col = "dist_centre", 
          style = "fisher", # algorithm to def cut points
          n = 10, # Number of requested cut points
          palette = cols, # colours
          alpha = 1, # transparency 
          title = "Distance", 
          legend.hist = FALSE # histogram next to map?
          ) +

            legend.title.size = 0.8,
            legend.text.size = 0.8)


mp2 <-  tm_shape(msoa.spdf) + 
  tm_fill(col = "dist_centre", 
          style = "quantile", # algorithm to def cut points

            legend.title.size = 0.8,
            legend.text.size = 0.8)


mp3 <-  tm_shape(msoa.spdf) + 
  tm_fill(col = "pubs_count", 
          style = "fisher", # algorithm to def cut points
          n = 10, # Number of requested cut points
          palette = cols, # colours
          alpha = 1, # transparency 
          title = "Count", 
          legend.hist = FALSE # histogram next to map?
          ) +
