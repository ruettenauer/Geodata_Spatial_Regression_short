    "text": "Introduction\nThis course material is designed for a 1-day GESIS workshop on spatial data analysis. Rüttenauer (2024) is a handbook chapter accompanying these workshop materials.\nIn recent years, more and more spatial data has become available, providing the possibility to combine otherwise unrelated data, such as social, economic, and environmental data. This also opens up the possibility of analyzing spatial patterns and processes (e.g., spillover effects or diffusion).\nMany social science research questions are spatially dependent such as voting outcomes, housing prices, labour markets, protest behavior, or migration decisions. Observing an event in one region or neighborhood increases the likelihood that we observe similar processes in proximate areas. As Tobler’s first law of geography puts it: “Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things”. This dependence can stem from spatial contagion, spatial spillovers, or common confounders. Therefore, basic assumptions of standard regression models are violated when analyzing spatial data. However, more imoprtantly, spatial processes are interesting for their own sake. Spatial regression models can detect spatial dependence and explicitly model spatial relations, identifying spatial clustering, spillovers or diffusion processes.\nThe main objective of the course is the theoretical understanding and practical application of spatial regression models. This course will first give an overview on how to perform common spatial operations using spatial information, such as aggregating spatial units, calculating distances, merging spatial data as well as visualizing them. The course will further focus on the analysis of geographic data and the application of spatial regression techniques to model and analyze spatial processes, and furthermore, the course addresses several methods for defining spatial relationships, detecting and diagnosing spatial dependence and autocorrelation. Finally, we will discuss various spatial regression techniques to model processes, clarify the assumptions of these models, and show how they differ in their applications and interpretations.\nThe field has developed very quickly over the past few years, and R now provides a rich set of packages for various spatial data operations. For a more in-depth introduction into spatial data analysis in R, have a look into the materials references below.\nThe material introduces the use of geographical information to connect and analyze different spatial data sources very briefly. This introduction is limited to the fundamentals of using geographical information in R. Stefan Jünger & Anne-Kathrin Stroppe have provided a comprehensive GESIS workshop on geospatial techniques in R. The focus of this workshop will be on techniques for spatial data analysis, such as spatial regression models."

    "text": "Some useful packages\nBy now, R provides a lot of functionalities for GIS applications and spatial econometrics, and further extensions. There are lots of packages providing a huge variety of spatial functionalities and methods (see e.g. R. Bivand, Millo, and Piras 2021). Important packages for fundamental spatial operations are:\n\nSpatial data workhorses: sf (Pebesma 2018) and terra\nVisualization: mapview (Appelhans et al. 2021) and tmap (Tennekes 2018)\nSpatial weights and other relations: spdep (R. S. Bivand and Rudel 2018)\nSpatial interpolation and kriging: gstat (Gräler, Pebesma, and Heuvelink 2016)\nSpatial regression models: spatialreg and sphet (R. Bivand and Piras 2015)\nThe packages have constantly developed over the past years, and older packages such as rgdal, rgeos, and sp are currently retiring (Blog post)"
